    <p>One in three Marylanders are living without reliable access to affordable
        healthy food, according to the Maryland Food Bank. </p>
    <p>The Food Recovery Network, which had a chapter founded at the University of Maryland in 2011, is an organization
        that aims to lessen the impact of food insecurity through taking leftover food from campus dining halls and
        distributing it to those in need.</p>
    <p>“I really like the purpose of it,” senior Nathan Gallagher, a current Food Recovery Network shift leader, said.
        “I tried to get as involved as I possibly could,” </p>
    <p>According to Gallagher, it is a great privilege to have the ability to take food that would otherwise be going to
        waste to the people who need it the most. </p>
    <p>“It’s a growing organization [The Food Recovery Network],” he said. Currently, the Food Recovery Network has
        active chapters in 45 states and D.C</p>
    <p>Each week, Food Recovery Network shift leaders, like Gallagher, work to package the food from the dining halls to
        prepare it for transportation.</p>
    <p>The chapter at UMD alone has donated over 300,000 pounds of food waste since its beginning. </p>

    </script>

    <p> The gap in the data during 2020 is due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
    <p>The UMD chapter was able to recover a little over 27,000 in the fall semester of 2016 alone, according to the
        Food Recovery network's statistics. </p>
    <p>However, the Food Recovery Network's shift leaders could not do this work without the help of volunteers. </p>
    <p>UMD junior Jonathan Porrazzo is one of the many volunteers who offers his time to help out.</p>
    <p>“To me, it’s a shame that all this food would normally go to waste,” he said. “We’re able to recover it though,
        which is really awesome,” </p>
    <p>Porrazzo expressed that volunteering is meaningful and rewarding to him because of the positive impact that he
        knows he is actively making.</p>
    <p>Freshman Tracey Ho, another volunteer, expressed a similar sentiment.</p>
    <p>“It is rewarding to know that I am giving back to others in that all of this food is going to go someone who
        otherwise would not have it and who needs it a lot,” she said. </p>
    <p>Sophomore Thomas Garda, a Food Recovery Network shift leader alongside Gallagher, said that he feels it is
        important to support the community around him.</p>
    <p>“It’s very inspiring and rewarding to help out even if you are helping out just a small amount of people,” Garda
        said.</p>
    <p>Together, Gallagher, Porrazzo, Ho, and Garda were able to package together 161.5 pounds of food on April 18th,
        2022, in order to transport it to those in need. </p>
    <p> Here is a breakdown of their packages for that day:</p>

    <p>The most prevalent food item on that day were vegetables, with 28 pounds being recovered.</p>
    <p> All of the food recovered on that day came from leftovers at the 251 North dining hall on UMD’s campus. </p>
    <p> “It is shocking to see just the insanely large amount of food that we recover,” Garda said. “When I first came
        into this position I did not expect really nearly half as much as what we recover,” </p>
    <p>Garda said that food waste and food insecurity are issues that he feels should be addressed.</p>
    <p> “The food waste problem, like many other problems, spans the whole country and whole world and it is an
        incredibly massive issue, much larger than I feel like a lot of people come to realize,” he said. </p>
