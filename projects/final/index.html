        <p>One in three Marylanders are living without reliable access to affordable
            healthy food, according to the Maryland Food Bank. </p>
        <p>The Food Recovery Network, an organization that was founded at the University of Maryland in 2011, aims to
            distribute leftover food from campus dining halls to those in need in order to lessen the impact of food
            insecurity in College Park. </p>
        <p>“I really like the purpose of it,” said senior Nathan Gallagher, a current Food Recovery Network shift
            leader. “I tried to get as involved as I possibly could,” </p>
        <p>According to Gallagher, it is a great privilege to have the ability to take food that would otherwise be
            going to waste to the people who need it the most. </p>
        <p>Currently, the Food Recovery Network has active chapters in 45 states and D.C</p>
        <p>"It's a growing organization," Gallagher said of the Food Recovery Network. </p>
        <p>Each week, Food Recovery Network shift leaders, like Gallagher, work to package the food from the dining
            halls to prepare it for transportation.</p>
        <p> UMD's chapter alone has donated over 300,000 pounds of what otherwise would have been food waste since its
            beginning over a decade ago,with nearly a tenth of that recovered in the fall semester of 2016 alone,
            according to data from the Food Recovery Network.</p>
        <p> Below is the data that the Food Recovery Network has compiled each semester as a record of UMD's chapter
            donations. The gap in the data during 2020 is due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

        <p>However, the Food Recovery Network's shift leaders could not do this work without the help of volunteers.</p>
        <p>“To me, it’s a shame that all this food would normally go to waste,” UMD junior and volunteer Jonathan
            Porrazzo said.
            “We’re able to recover it though, which is really awesome,” </p>
        <p>Porrazzo expressed that volunteering is meaningful and rewarding to him because of the positive impact that
            he knows he is actively making.</p>
        <p>Freshman Tracey Ho, another volunteer, expressed a similar sentiment.</p>
        <p>“It is rewarding to know that I am giving back to others in that all of this food is going to go to someone
            who otherwise would not have it and who needs it a lot,” she said. </p>
        <p>Sophomore Thomas Garda, a Food Recovery Network shift leader alongside Gallagher, said that he feels it is
            important to support the community around him.</p>
        <p>“It’s very inspiring and rewarding to help out even if you are helping out just a small amount of people,”
            Garda said.</p>
        <p>Together, Gallagher, Porrazzo, Ho, and Garda were able to package together nearly 162 pounds of food on April
            18th to transport it to those in need. </p>
        <p> Here is a breakdown of their packages for that day:</p>

        <p> All of the food on that day was recovered from one of the three dining halls on UMD's campus, 251
            North. The most prevelant food item that day were vegetables, which had a recorded 28 pounds being
            recovered. </p>
        <p> “It is shocking to see just the insanely large amount of food that we recover,” Garda said. “When I first
            came into this position I did not expect really nearly half as much as what we recover,” </p>
        <p> “The food waste problem, like many other problems, spans the whole country and whole world and it is an
            incredibly massive issue, much larger than I feel like a lot of people come to realize,” he said, noting
            that it's an issue he feels should be further addressed. </p>
