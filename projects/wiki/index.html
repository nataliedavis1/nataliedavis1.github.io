    <h2> HISTORY </h2>

    <p> Shep and Ian Murray originally sold neckties on Martha's Vineyard, selling out of a backpack from their boat or
        Jeep rather than a storefront. Initially, they offered four different styles of ties. After they sold 800 ties
        on a single weeekend in July, Shep and Ian quickly re-ordered more, paid off their accrued debt, and moved into
        a new office. The Murray brothers claim that the business was founded through a philosophy of "living the good
        life," which is reflected by their slogan "Every day should feel this good." Vineyard Vines is still owned
        outright by the two Murray brothers.</p>
    <h2>EXPANSION</h2>
    <p>Since the summer of 1998, the Vineyard Vines company has expanded nationally, particularly along the East Coast.
        Vineyard Vines has opened numerous company, outlet, and retail stores. In addition to these traditional
        channels, Vineyard Vines has expanded its sales to online shoppers. The company manufactures licensed NFL and
        MLB product, which it sells through its retail channels. Vineyard Vines also manufactures licensed college
        apparel, which is sold primarily through campus stores. Vineyard Vines placed on Inc. magazine's list of the
        5000 fastest-growing businesses in the U.S. in 2007. Between 2004 and 2007, the relatively new company's revenue
        tripled.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> In 2015, the company inaugurated a new headquarters in Stamford, Conneticut. </li>
        <li> In 2016, Vineyard Vines sold 476 million dollars. In that same year the company was reportedly valued at
            one billion dollars by Goldman Sachs.</li>
        <li>In 2019, Target Corporation offered a 300-product limited edition Vineyard Vines collection in stores and
            online. The campaign drew some criticism from customers, as many items sold out within an hour.</li>
        <li> All Vineyard Vines stores were temporarily closed in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</li>
        <li> While expanding the sales, the production is mostly placed into Non-U.S. locations, such as China and South
            America. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STORES</h2>
    <p> The first stores were opened in Northeastern locations associated with the sea such as Martha's Vineyard. The
        first was in Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard, followed by Greenwich, Conneticut. The company has expanded to more
        than 100 stores across the U.S. states and the brand is sold by over 600 other retailers. </p>
